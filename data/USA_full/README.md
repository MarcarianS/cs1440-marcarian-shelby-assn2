# [BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages](https://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm)

This is the home page for this data set.  Here you can find the most official
documentation about this data set as well as data sets for previous quarters
and years.

In the past the official version of this file had been changed without warning,
which led to confusion as it changed the results our programs came up with.  To
avoid this problem download the zipped data file from
[here](https://gitlab.cs.usu.edu/erik.falor/cs1440-falor-erik-assn2/uploads/8703b867882ff67788c59129620064f5/2019_annual_singlefile.zip)
instead.

Unzip the file into this directory, leaving its filename intact.
